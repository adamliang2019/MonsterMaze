Player Move:
Direction is taken using UserInput class and is checked using Game's validMove(Direction) method.
If it is valid. The Direction is passed into Game's advanceTurn(Direct) method.
Game uses Turns object to make the corresponding hero turn on the Map object.
The game then updates the game state/stats (win/lose/powerlevel/monsters alive/etc).

Print Map:
Map object has a method to return a matrix of type Cell where Cell == Cell.obscured where the map is unexplored.
This Cell matrix is passed from Game to Main, where Main displays the map using GameUI.
GameUI prints the matrix with a corresponding symbol for each Cell value. (ex. Cell.obscured == ".", Cell.empty == " ")
